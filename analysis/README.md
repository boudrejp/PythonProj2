# Analysis
A folder for us to put our progress in analyzing our data set, and to eventually merge into one document.

* Each person has done separate analyses in individual jupyter notebooks. Each may include multiple data sources.
  * __PreProcessingPolls__ takes our raw poll data (`democrats2016.csv` and `republicans2016.csv` in the `data` folder of this repository and performs sanity checks while manipulating them into `campaign_length.csv`, found in the `data` folder of this repository 
  * __John_Analysis__ includes analysis of the following sub-questions:
    * How many candidates do rappers tend to rap about?
    * Do the number of mentions tend to relate to how long a candidate was in the race?
    * more?
