# Proposal for Group 2, Monday 4PM Summer 2018
Project team: Zeliang (Douglas) Xu, Katie Mo, John Boudreaux

Our analysis will broadly answer the question: *__How were the candidates in the 2016 US presidential election portrayed by hip hop artists?__*

## __Data__

We found a data set from fivethirtyeight.com that provided for the number of times that the candidates for the 2016 US presidential campaign were mentioned in hip hop songs. This is in `data/HipHopLyrics.csv`. The data has 378 entries and the following columns (more information in the 'data' directory of this repository):
* __candidate__: the candidate referenced
  * Uses:
* __song__: song name
  * Uses:
* __sentiment__: positive, negative, or neutral (based on analysis by fivethirtyeight)
  * Uses:
* __album_release_date__: year of album release
  * Uses:
* __line__: the specific lyric mentioning the candidate
  * Uses:
* __url__: link to full song lyrics
  * Uses: probably just as a reference, will not be used actively in this analysis

Additionally, we are bringing in data sets for polling numbers for the 2016 presidential election. These are found in the `data/democrats2016.csv` (169 entires) and `data/republicans2016.csv` (171 entries). This will serve as support for our analysis by giving perspective of how long the candidates were in the race, and relatively how popular they are. While more sophisticated time series analysis could be done, that is beyond the scope of this assignment. All analysis will be around aggregations and averages. Both data tables have the following columns:
* __Poll__: - the poller
  * Uses:
* __Date__: the dates the poll was conducted
  * Uses:
* __Sample__: the sample size (need to double check into this one)
  * Uses:
* __Candidate Specific Numbers__: the percentage for each individual candidate in that poll
  * Uses:
* __Spread__: the candidate who is winning in this poll, and by how much
  * Uses:

## __Analysis__

To answer our broader topic question, several smaller questions will be answered. These will include, but are not limited to:

* What events lead to song lyric mentions?
(image of visual here)
* Do rappers talk about one candidate? Or multiple?
(image of visual here)
* Are candidates talked about before they run for president? Or only because they are in public eye?
(image of visual here)
* How has Trumpâ€™s image in rap changed over time with changing roles in public eye?
(image of visual here)
* Do song mentions tend to correlate to how long a candidate was in the race?
(image of visual here)
* Are some politicians viewed more positively/negatively than others?

## __Final Proposal__

Our final proposal will be structured as a report of around 8-10 pages, with an overall structure of the following:
* Introduction to the data
* Question groupings
  * Individual questions
    * Analysis and embedded figures
  * Conclusions about the question grouping
* Overall Conclusions

The questions will be grouped by topics. For instance, we might address multiple questions about the relationship between song references and the candidates' roles in the public eye in one grouping, positivity and negativity of each candidate in another, and other groupings as make sense.
